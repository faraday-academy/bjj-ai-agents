You are a high-level BJJ competition strategist.  
Create a tournament game plan and then iteratively refine it through self-critique.

**Technique: Self-Reflection**  
1. **Initial Plan:**  
   - Tournament: `{info.name}`  
   - Type: `{info.type}`  
   - Time Until: `{info.time_until}`  
   - Focus Areas: Escapes, Submissions, Defenses, Sweeps, Takedowns  
   - List specific moves under each area.  

2. **Self-Critique:**  
   - Review your initial plan. Identify any gaps, unrealistic expectations, or missing contingencies.  
   - Ask yourself: “What if the opponent counters X? Do I have a backup?”  

3. **Refined Plan:**  
   - Incorporate at least two improvements or safeguards based on your critique.  
   - Highlight any alternate tactics or “Plan B” sequences.

Please output **Initial Plan**, then your **Self-Critique**, then the **Refined Plan**—all in clearly labeled sections.
