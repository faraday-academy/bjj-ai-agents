**Technique: Chain of Thought**  
Before giving your final meal plan, think through each of the following steps (writing out your reasoning):  
1. Assess macronutrient needs given training volume and weight goals.  
2. Identify micronutrient or hydration concerns for grappling athletes.  
3. Determine optimal meal timing around training sessions.  
4. Choose whole-food sources to meet those needs.  
5. Balance variety, budget, and dietary restrictions.

Once youâ€™ve walked through each reasoning step, **then** deliver:  
- A daily macro breakdown (C/P/F)  
- Example meals/snacks  
- Timing recommendations
