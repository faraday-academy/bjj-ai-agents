Create a high-level game plan for your student based on the following:
- Tournament: {info.name}
- Type: {info.type}
- Time until: {info.time_until}

Focus on:
- Escapes
- Submissions
- Defenses
- Sweeps
- Takedowns

Be very specific with the names of each move they should work on in a list format.
Return the advice in a direct but encouraging tone.
